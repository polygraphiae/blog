title: Google 2FA Desperately Needs A Security Update
tags: [2fa, google, broken]

Yesterday, my friend [@zooko](https://twitter.com/zooko) reminded me of a
glaring, still open issue: that
Google is still encouraging users to use SMS-based 2FA in their security
setup UX.

This is terrible, and Google can do better. (Usually, they do.)

NIST even went so far as to deprecate all SMS-based 2FA last year.

The smart money has known for a while that the only safe way to use 2FA with
a Google account is to set it up (which bafflingly *requires* a phone number
for SMS to even enable 2FA), enable
[TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm)
(generated by an app like Authy or Google Authenticator) and then, *most
importantly*, entirely remove their phone number from the account, undoing
the side-effect of step 1.

This is important because Google allows anyone trying to log in as you
(including an attacker that has stolen your phone account and can receive
your texts) to 2FA authenticate *with any available method*.  Even if you
are using TOTP or a U2F Yubikey to log in every day, anyone with your username
and password and phone number can still log in using SMS 2FA if the phone
number is still on your account.

Google, fix this.  Prompt TOTP users to remove their phone number, or at
least prompt them to disable SMS-based 2FA when they enable TOTP.
(Especially for U2F users!)

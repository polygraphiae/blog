My friend [@zooko](https://twitter.com/zooko) reminded me the other day that
Google is still encouraging users to use SMS-based 2FA in their security
setup UX.

The smart money has known for a while that the only safe way to use 2FA with
a Google account is to set it up (which requires a phone number for SMS),
enable
[TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm)
(generated by an app like Authy or Google Authenticator) and then, *most
importantly*, entirely remove their phone number from the account, because
Google allows anyone trying to log in as you (including an attacker that has
stolen your phone account and can receive your texts) to 2FA authenticate
*with any available method*.  Even if you are using TOTP to log in every
day, anyone with your username and password and phone number can still log
in using SMS 2FA if the phone number is still on your account.

Google, fix this.  Prompt TOTP users to remove their phone number, or at
least prompt them to disable SMS-based 2FA when they enable TOTP.
